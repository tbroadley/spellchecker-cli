# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Upgrade junit-report-builder to fix a deprecation warning when installing the package.

## [6.0.1] - 2022-07-23

- Fix an issue where the tool crashes if installed globally.

## [6.0.0] - 2022-07-23

- Use `pkg-dir` instead of `app-root-path` to find a Spellchecker CLI config file. `pkg-dir` looks for the root directory of a Node.js project by searching up from the current working directory for a directory containing a `package.json` file. This is simpler than `app-root-path`'s strategy.

## [5.0.1] - 2022-07-21

- Rebuild package with LF line endings instead of CRLF.

## [5.0.0] - 2022-07-15

- Spellchecker now uses ES modules instead of CommonJS modules. This means that the tool will fail to import personal dictionaries from `.js` files that use CommonJS module syntax. To fix this, change the personal dictionary file's extension from `.js` to `.cjs`.
- Fix an issue where the `:gear:` Gemoji would show up as a spelling mistake.

## [4.11.0] - 2022-05-21

## [3.1.0] - 2018-06-12

### Added

- Added a `--no-suggestions` option, which allows users to disable the generation of spelling suggestions when errors are detected.

## [3.0.3] - 2018-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the spell checking was skipped after 30 found misspell errors, even if they are matched by one of `--ignore` patterns.

## [3.0.2] - 2018-04-14

### Fixed

- Updated [`retext-indefinite-article`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-indefinite-article) to 1.1.3 in order to properly expect "a" in front of words like "1-to-1" and "1:00".

## [3.0.1] - 2017-12-30

### Added

- Log a count of the files to be spellchecked.
- Add a large number of unit and end-to-end tests.

  - [`retext-syntax-mentions`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-syntax-mentions)
